              <p>ELIXIR Ireland is delighted to announce our Spring 2024 training programme, offering a comprehensive series of courses designed to build bioinformatics skills and advance computational biology expertise. Registration is now open for all courses, with both in-person and online options available to accommodate diverse learning preferences.</p>

              <h2>Course Offerings</h2>
              <p>Our Spring programme includes a carefully curated selection of courses covering essential and advanced topics in bioinformatics:</p>

              <h3>Introduction to RNA-seq Analysis</h3>
              <p><strong>Dates:</strong> April 15-17, 2024<br>
              <strong>Format:</strong> In-person (Trinity College Dublin) and Online<br>
              This three-day intensive course covers the complete RNA-seq analysis pipeline, from quality control and alignment to differential expression analysis and functional interpretation. Participants will gain hands-on experience using popular tools including FastQC, STAR, and DESeq2.</p>

              <h3>Machine Learning for Bioinformatics</h3>
              <p><strong>Dates:</strong> May 6-8, 2024<br>
              <strong>Format:</strong> In-person (University College Dublin) and Online<br>
              Explore the application of machine learning techniques to biological data analysis. This course covers supervised and unsupervised learning methods, feature selection, model validation, and practical applications in genomics and proteomics research.</p>

              <h3>Data Management Best Practices</h3>
              <p><strong>Dates:</strong> May 20-21, 2024<br>
              <strong>Format:</strong> Online only<br>
              Learn how to implement FAIR data principles in your research workflow. Topics include metadata standards, data documentation, version control, and preparing data management plans for grant applications.</p>

              <h2>Who Should Attend</h2>
              <p>These courses are designed for researchers, PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, and bioinformatics professionals who want to enhance their computational skills. Each course is structured to accommodate participants with varying levels of experience, from beginners to advanced practitioners.</p>

              <h2>Learning Approach</h2>
              <p>All courses combine theoretical lectures with practical hands-on exercises using real biological datasets. Participants will work through guided tutorials and have opportunities to apply learned techniques to their own research questions. All course materials, including lecture slides, code examples, and datasets, will be provided to registered participants.</p>

              <h2>Registration Details</h2>
              <p>Early bird registration is available until March 15th, 2024. Fees vary by course format and participant category (student, academic, industry). Limited scholarships are available for students and early career researchers.</p>

              <p>To view the full course schedule, detailed syllabi, and instructor information, please visit our training page. For registration inquiries or questions about course content, contact our training team at <a href="mailto:training@elixir-ireland.org">training@elixir-ireland.org</a>.</p>

              <h2>Prerequisites and Technical Requirements</h2>
              <p>Basic programming knowledge (R or Python) is recommended for most courses. Specific prerequisites are listed on each course page. Participants will need access to a computer with internet connection, and detailed setup instructions will be provided prior to course commencement.</p>

              <h2>Continuing Education</h2>
              <p>Certificates of completion will be awarded to all participants who successfully complete the coursework. These courses may count toward continuing professional development (CPD) requirements. Please check with your institution regarding CPD credit recognition.</p>
